# WHOiB - The personality Analyzer

> “Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom.” ― Aristotle

Self-reflection can be a fruitful and and worthwhile endeavor, but without quantitative input, it can lead to self-deprecation. With advances in natural language processing, self-assessments can be quantified and lead to concrete goals for improvement or just a better understanding of one’s personality traits. WhoIB can take your text interactions and thoughts to give you a snapshot of your tone. In the long-term, we will build a personality profile that will give you insights into Who U B.
